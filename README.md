# EdgeDetector

### History
This is a former project (called DiaCheck) created for medical image analysis. The original projected has been abandoned but remaining code has been made available here for public use.
All existing commits remains in the tree, so if there is any interest of the previous code, just check earlier commits.

### Current use
What remains is an implementation of an edge detection algorithm known as [Sobel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uihBwtPIBxM) which could
be quite useful in some scenarios.
